**Eclair** is a scala implementation of the Lightning Network. Eclair is french for Lightning.

This software follows the [Lightning Network Specifications](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc), also known as BOLTs. Other implementations of BOLTs include:
- [lightning-c]
- [lnd]
- [lit]
 
 :construction: Both BOLTs and Eclair itself are a work in progress. Expect things to break/change!
 
 :warning: Eclair currently only runs on regtest or testnet.

## Overview

Eclair intends to be a full-fledged Lightning node. It can run with or without a GUI, and a JSON-RPC API is also available.

Current version requires a synchronized, non-pruning, tx-indexing [Bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) node.

Available actions:
- Open a channel with another lightning node
- Display opened channels with the node (status, balance, capacity, ...)
- Receive payments from another node
- Send payments to another node

## Installation

The project is under heavy development and no release is available yet. Still you can download the sources, compile the project with Maven (cf Â§Development) and run it on localhost.

---

## Development

#### Set up the environment
- JDK 1.8+
- [Latest Scala installation](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- A segwit version of bitcoin core in testnet or regtest mode

:warning: eclair currently runs on regtest/segnet only. **Do not try and modify it to run on bitcoin mainnet!**

- Make sure that bitcoin-cli is on the path and edit ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf and add:
```
server=1
regtest=1
rpcuser=***
rpcpassword=***
```

#### Run

- Download the sources and build the executable JAR with the following command:
```shell
$ mvn package -DskipTests
```
- Start bitcoind
- Mine enough blocks to activate segwit blocks:
```shell
$ bitcoin-cli generate 500
```
- Navigate to `eclair-node/target` and execute the jar `eclair-node_2.11-0.2-SNAPSHOT-xxxxxx-capsule-fat.jar`

```shell
$ java 
     -Declair.bitcoind.rpcuser=foo
     -Declair.bitcoind.rpcpassword=bar
     -jar eclair-node_2.11-0.2-SNAPSHOT-xxxxxx-capsule-fat.jar
```

#### JVM Options

## JSON-RPC API

 method       |  params                             | description
 -------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
  connect     | host, port, anchor_amount           | opens a channel with another eclair or lightningd instance
  list        |                                     | lists existing channels
  addhtlc     | channel_id, amount, rhash, locktime | sends an htlc
  fulfillhtlc | channel_id, r                       | fulfills an htlc
  close       | channel_id                          | closes a channel
  help        |                                     | displays available methods
