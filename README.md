**Eclair** (french for Lightning) is a scala implementation of the Lightning Network. It can run with or without a GUI, and a JSON-RPC API is also available.

This software follows the [Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc). Other implementations include [lightning-c], [lit], and [lnd].
 
 ---
 
 :construction: Both the BOLTs and Eclair itself are a work in progress. Expect things to break/change!
 
 :warning: Eclair currently only runs on regtest or testnet. We recommend testing in regtest, as it allows you to generate blocks manually and not wait for confirmations.

## Lightning Network Specification Compliance
[Eclair 0.2-alpha1](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha1) is compliant with the BOLTs at commit [06a5e6cbdbb4c6f8b8dab444de497cdb9c7d7f02](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/commit/06a5e6cbdbb4c6f8b8dab444de497cdb9c7d7f02), with the following caveats:

  - [X] BOLT 1: Base Protocol
  - [X] BOLT 2: Peer Protocol for Channel Management
  - [X] BOLT 3: Bitcoin Transaction and Script Formats
  - [X] BOLT 4: Onion Routing Protocol
  - [X] BOLT 5: Recommendations for On-chain Transaction Handling
    * If a revoked commitment tx is published, only the offender's main output will be stolen as punishment, not the HTLCs.
  - [X] BOLT 7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery
  - [X] BOLT 8: Encrypted and Authenticated Transport
  - [X] BOLT 9: Assigned Feature Flags

## Overview

## Installation

### Configuring Bitcoin Core

Eclair needs a _synchronized_, _segwit-ready_, _non-pruning_, _tx-indexing_ [Bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) node.

Run bitcoind with the following `bitcoin.conf`:
```
regtest=1
server=1
rpcuser=XXX
rpcpassword=XXX
txindex=1
```

### Installing Eclair

#### Windows

Just use the windows installer, it should create a shortcut on your desktop.

#### Linux, MacOs or manual install on Windows

You need to first install java, more precisely a JRE 1.8+.

Then just grab the latest fat jar and run:
```shell
java -jar eclair-node_xxxxxx-fat.jar
```

### Configuring Eclair

Eclair will create a directory in `~/.eclair` by default. You may change this directory's location using `--datadir <dir>` command line argument.

If you want to change configuration parameters, create a file named `eclair.conf` in eclair's home directory.

:warning: Using separate `datadir` is mandatory if you want to run several instances of eclair on the same machine. You will also have to change ports.


option                       | description               | default value
-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------
 eclair.server.port          | TCP port                  | 9735
 eclair.api.port            | HTTP port                 | 8080
 eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser     | Bitcoin Core RPC user     | foo
 eclair.bitcoind.rpcpassword | Bitcoin Core RPC password | bar
