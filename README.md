**Eclair** (french for Lightning) is a scala implementation of the Lightning Network. It can run with or without a GUI, and a JSON-RPC API is also available.

This software follows the [Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc). Other implementations include [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) and [lnd](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd).
 
 ---
 
 :construction: Both the BOLTs and Eclair itself are still a work in progress. Expect things to break/change!
 
 :rotating_light: If you intend to run Eclair on mainnet:
 - Keep in mind that it is beta-quality software and **don't put too much money** in it
 - Eclair's JSON-RPC API should **NOT** be accessible from the outside world (similarly to Bitcoin Core API)
 - Specific [configuration instructions for mainnet](#mainnet-usage) are provided below (by default Eclair runs on testnet)
 
---

## Lightning Network Specification Compliance
Please see the latest [release note](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases) for detailed information on BOLT compliance.

## Overview

## Installation

### Configuring Bitcoin Core

:warning: Eclair requires Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 or higher. If you are upgrading an existing wallet, you need to create a new address and send all your funds to that address.

Eclair needs a _synchronized_, _segwit-ready_, **_zeromq-enabled_**, _wallet-enabled_, _non-pruning_, _tx-indexing_ [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) node. 
Eclair will use any BTC it finds in the Bitcoin Core wallet to fund any channels you choose to open. Eclair will return BTC from closed channels to this wallet.

Run bitcoind with the following minimal `bitcoin.conf`:
```
testnet=1
server=1
rpcuser=foo
rpcpassword=bar
txindex=1
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
addresstype=p2sh-segwit
```

:warning: If you are using Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 you need to add following line to your `bitcoin.conf`:
```
deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction
```

### Installing Eclair

The released binaries can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases).

#### Windows

Just use the windows installer, it should create a shortcut on your desktop.

#### Linux, macOS or manual install on Windows

You need to first install java, more precisely a [JRE 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).

 :warning: If you are using the OpenJDK JRE, you will need to build OpenJFX yourself, or run the application in headless mode (see below).

Then download the latest fat jar and depending on whether or not you want a GUI run the following command:
* with GUI:
```shell
java -jar eclair-node-gui-<version>-<commit_id>.jar
```
* without GUI:
```shell
java -jar eclair-node-<version>-<commit_id>.jar
```

### Configuring Eclair

#### Configuration file

Eclair reads its configuration file, and write its logs, to `~/.eclair` by default.

To change your node's configuration, create a file named `eclair.conf` in `~/.eclair`. Here's an example configuration file:

```
eclair.chain=testnet
eclair.node-alias=eclair
eclair.node-color=49daaa
```

Here are some of the most common options:

name                         | description                                                                           | default value
-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------
 eclair.chain                | Which blockchain to use: *regtest*, *testnet* or *mainnet*                            | testnet
 eclair.server.port          | Lightning TCP port                                                                    | 9735
 eclair.api.enabled          | Enable/disable the API                                                                | false. By default the API is disabled. If you want to enable it, you must set a password.
 eclair.api.port             | API HTTP port                                                                         | 8080
 eclair.api.password         | API password (BASIC)                                                                  | "" (must be set if the API is enabled)
 eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser     | Bitcoin Core RPC user                                                                 | foo
 eclair.bitcoind.rpcpassword | Bitcoin Core RPC password                                                             | bar
 eclair.bitcoind.zmq         | Bitcoin Core ZMQ address                                                              | "tcp://127.0.0.1:29000"
 eclair.gui.unit             | Unit in which amounts are displayed (possible values: msat, sat, mbtc, btc)           | btc 

Quotes are not required unless the value contains special characters. Full syntax guide [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

&rarr; see [`reference.conf`](eclair-core/src/main/resources/reference.conf) for full reference. There are many more options!

#### Java Environment Variables

Some advanced parameters can be changed with java environment variables. Most users won't need this and can skip this section.

:warning: Using separate `datadir` is mandatory if you want to run **several instances of eclair** on the same machine. You will also have to change ports in `eclair.conf` (see above).

name                  | description                                | default value
----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------
eclair.datadir        | Path to the data directory                 | ~/.eclair
eclair.headless       | Run eclair without a GUI                   | 
eclair.printToConsole | Log to stdout (in addition to eclair.log)  |

For example, to specify a different data directory you would run the following command:
```shell
java -Declair.datadir=/tmp/node1 -jar eclair-node-gui-<version>-<commit_id>.jar
```

#### Logging

Eclair uses [`logback`](https://logback.qos.ch) for logging. To use a different configuration, and override the internal logback.xml, run:

```shell
java -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/logback-custom.xml -jar eclair-node-gui-<version>-<commit_id>.jar
```

## Docker

A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) image is built on each commit on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/acinq/eclair) for running a dockerized eclair-node.

You can use the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to set arguments to `eclair-node`.

```
docker run -ti --rm -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m -Declair.api.binding-ip=0.0.0.0 -Declair.node-alias=node-pm -Declair.printToConsole" acinq/eclair
```

If you want to persist the data directory, you can make the volume to your host with the `-v` argument, as the following example:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v "/path_on_host:/data" -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Declair.printToConsole" acinq/eclair
```

## Mainnet usage

Following are the minimum configuration files you need to use for Bitcoin Core and Eclair.

### Bitcoin Core configuration

```
testnet=0
server=1
rpcuser=<your-rpc-user-here>
rpcpassword=<your-rpc-password-here>
txindex=1
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
addresstype=p2sh-segwit
```

:warning: If you are using Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 you need to add following line to your `bitcoin.conf`:
```
deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction
```

You may also want to take advantage of the new configuration sections in `bitcoin.conf` to manage parameters that are network speficic, so you can reasliy run your bitcoin node on both mainnet and testnet. For example you could use:

```
server=1
txindex=1
addresstype=p2sh-segwit
deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction
[main]
rpcuser=<your-mainnet-rpc-user-here>
rpcpassword=<your-mainnet-rpc-password-here>
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
[test]
rpcuser=<your-testnet-rpc-user-here>
rpcpassword=<your-testnet-rpc-password-here>
zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29001
zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29001
```

### Eclair configuration

```
eclair.chain=mainnet
eclair.bitcoind.rpcport=8332
eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser=<your-mainnet-rpc-user-here>
eclair.bitcoind.rpcpassword=<your-mainnet-rpc-password-here>
```
