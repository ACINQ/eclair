  * This actor will synchronously make a backup of the database it was initialized with whenever it receives
  * a ChannelPersisted event.
  * To avoid piling up messages and entering an endless backup loop, it is supposed to be used with a bounded mailbox
  * with a single item:
  *
  * backup-mailbox {
  *   mailbox-type = "akka.dispatch.BoundedMailbox"
  *   mailbox-capacity = 1
  *   mailbox-push-timeout-time = 0
  * }
  *
  * Messages that cannot be processed will be sent to dead letters
  *
  * @param databases  database to backup
  * @param backupFile backup file
  *
  * Constructor is private so users will have to use BackupHandler.props() which always specific a custom mailbox
