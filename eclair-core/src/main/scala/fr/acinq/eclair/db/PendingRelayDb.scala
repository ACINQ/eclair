/**
  * This database stores the preimages that we have received from downstream

  * blockchain).
  *
  * This means that this database is only used in the context of *relaying* payments.

  * We need to be sure that if downstream is able to pulls funds from us, we can always
  * do the same from upstream, otherwise we lose money. Hence the need for persistence
  * to handle all corner cases.
