/**
 * This actor handles outgoing connections to a peer. The goal is to free the [[Peer]] actor from the reconnection logic
 * and have it just react to already established connections, independently of whether those connections are incoming or
 * outgoing.
 *
 * The base assumption is that the [[Peer]] will send its state transitions to the [[ReconnectionTask]] actor.
 *
 * This is more complicated than it seems and there are various corner cases to consider:
 * - multiple available addresses
 * - concurrent outgoing connections and conflict between automated/user-requested attempts
 * - concurrent incoming/outgoing connections and risk of reconnection loops
 * - etc.
