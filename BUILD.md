# Building Eclair

## Requirements

- [OpenJDK 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot).
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.6.0 or newer
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 18.03 or newer (optional) if you want to run all tests

## Build

Eclair is packaged as a compressed archive with a launcher script, the archives are built deterministically
so it's possible to reproduce the build and verify its equality byte-by-byte. To build the exact same artifacts 
that we release, you must use the build environment (OS, JDK, maven...) that we specify in our release notes.

To build the project and run the tests, simply run:

```shell
mvn package
```

### Other build options

To skip all tests, run:

```shell
mvn package -DskipTests
```

To only build the `eclair-node` module, run:

```shell
mvn package -pl eclair-node -am -DskipTests
```

To run the tests, run:

```shell
mvn test
```

To run tests for a specific class, run:

```shell
mvn test -Dsuites=*<TestClassName>
```

To skip fuzz tests, run:

```shell
mvn test -DtagsToExclude=fuzzy
```

## Build the API documentation

### Slate

The API doc is generated via slate and hosted on github pages. To make a change and update the doc follow the steps:

1. `git checkout slate-doc`
2. Install your local dependencies for slate, more info [here](https://github.com/lord/slate#getting-started-with-slate)
3. Edit `source/index.html.md` and save your changes.
4. Commit all the changes to git, before deploying the repo should be clean.
5. Push your commit to remote.
6. Run `./deploy.sh`
7. Wait a few minutes and the doc should be updated at [https://acinq.github.io/eclair](https://acinq.github.io/eclair)
