Error Code | Error Name | Description
---------- | -------- | ----------
400 | Bad Request | Your request contains malformed or missing parameters 
401 | Unauthorized | Wrong or no auth supplied
404 | Not Found | The specified method could not be found.
500 | Internal Server Error | We had a problem with our server. Try again later.
