## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key E04E48E72C205463. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf2.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf2.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc > SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 24.04.1
- Adoptium OpenJDK 21.0.6

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-<version>-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 21, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.
